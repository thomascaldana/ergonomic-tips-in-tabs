                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    We don’t normally think of an office as being an unsafe
                    workplace. However, office work can pose a serious hidden
                    risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to repetitive
                    motions, sedentary workdays, eye strain, and numerous other
                    factors.

                            <h3>What Is Workplace Ergonomics?</h3>
                            Ergonomics is an approach to healthy mobility,
                            seating, and
                            overall posture in the workplace. The traditional
                            workplace
                            ergonomics definition is that a person’s work
                            environment
                            should be adapted to their body, not the other way
                            around.
                        </p>

                    <div class="tabs__content" data-tab="2">
                        <h2>Tip 1</h2>
                        <p>
                            Invest in the right office furniture and equipment:
                            Once you’ve identified the risks of specific groups
                            of employees, you can begin looking for solutions to
                            improve their work behaviors.
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            Consider ergonomic
                            office furniture, like standing desks, chairs that
                            promote a neutral posture, or monitor risers that
                            keep the head and neck aligned and prevent
                            straining.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabs__content" data-tab="3">
                        <h2>Tip 2</h2>
                        <p>
                            Promote varying work positions: Though
                            ergonomics in the workplace has existed for many
                            decades, it’s only in recent years that
                            occupational health experts have started
                            promoting the ability to vary working positions
                            throughout the day to prevent prolonged sitting.
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            Adjustable standing desks, also known as
                            sit-stand desks, are a way to encourage workers
                            to stand more throughout the day, which helps
                            boost circulation and alleviate compression in
                            the low back.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabs__content" data-tab="4">

                        <p>
                            Encourage movement breaks: Encouraging movement
                            breaks can help reverse some of the posture problems
                            related to prolonged sitting, like hunching and
                            slouching. 
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            During movement breaks, workers are
                            encouraged to do certain stretches to help lengthen
                            the muscles in the back, shoulders, neck, and chest,
                            and to reduce eye strain and headaches.
                        </p>
