                    We don’t normally think of an office as being an unsafe
                    workplace. However, office work can pose a serious hidden
                    risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to repetitive
                    motions, sedentary workdays, eye strain, and numerous other
                    factors.

                            Invest in the right office furniture and equipment:
                            Once you’ve identified the risks of specific groups
                            of employees, you can begin looking for solutions to
                            improve their work behaviors. Consider ergonomic
                            office furniture, like standing desks, chairs that
                            promote a neutral posture, or monitor risers that
                            keep the head and neck aligned and prevent
                            straining.

                            <strong>What Is a Seizure?</strong>
                            <br/>
                                Promote varying work positions: Though
                                ergonomics in the workplace has existed for many
                                decades, it’s only in recent years that
                                occupational health experts have started
                                promoting the ability to vary working positions
                                throughout the day to prevent prolonged sitting.
                                Adjustable standing desks, also known as
                                sit-stand desks, are a way to encourage workers
                                to stand more throughout the day, which helps
                                boost circulation and alleviate compression in
                                the low back.
